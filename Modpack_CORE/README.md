# ZenModpack: Core

This Modpack originated from my desire for a custom high performance Valheim experience. I wanted to avoid all the conflicts of bundling a bunch of mods together that may or may not work correctly with each other or have overlapping functionality because they were all written by different authors with different ideas and UI paradigms.

Therefor all ZenMods were written and designed to work together seamlessly.  When combined, these mods operate as a single symbiotic whole. Yet, due to their modular nature, each one can function individually as well.

Best with these Valheim world modifiers enabled:
- NoMap - Getting lost is fun!
- PlayerEvents aka Player Based Events / Raids
